*** Binary Search ***

**Problem** -- 	

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 9 exists in nums and its index is 4</pre>

**Problem 2 First_bad_v -**--

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
